                        <p>In the shift towards a microservices architecture, I helped design the format for future mongoDB document schemas.</p>

                        <p>I built a number of different scripts to help developers generate schemas from existing collections, ODM classes, etc. They were used many times even after my term ended with little issues.</p>
